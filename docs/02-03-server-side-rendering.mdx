To enable `SSR` you should provide the `--ssrEnabled` flag. With this flag Ragu will start to return the micro-frontend
HTML rendered from server.

<PackageManager binExecution={true} both="ragu-cli dev --file my-mfe.js --ssrEnabled" />

```json {8}
{
  "dependencies": [],
  "client": "http://localhost:3100/compiled/client-side/my-mfe.[hash].js",
  "ssrEnabled": false,
  "static": false,
  "styles": [],
  "resolverFunction": "my-mfe_my-mfe",
  "html": "Hello, World",
  "state": null,
  "props": {}
}
```

After you activate the flag you will see a tiny difference into the micro-frontend's manifest file.
When `SSR` is enabled, Ragu's manifest returns the `html` property which is the result of your application.

## The state file

Let's say you want your micro-frontend to perform an async operation, fetching a request for example. You can use
a state file for this purpose. A state file is only executed from the server side, that means that the browser will
never perform that action. Also, the state will be passed as a property to your micro-frontend.

The state file must export a default function that returns a `Promise`.
Properties received by the `state` function are the same described at
[Micro-frontend API](/docs/micro-frontends#receiving-parameters).

```javascript title="state.js"
export default async ({params}) => {
  if (!params.number) {
    return null;
  }

  const pokemonResponse = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${params.number}`);
  const pokemonResponseBody = await pokemonResponse.json();

  return {
    name: pokemonResponseBody.name
  }
}
```

The result will be provided to your micro-frontend as a query parameter.

```javascript title="my-mfe.js"
export default ({params, state}) => {
  if (!params.number) {
    return {
      html: `You must provide the number parameter`
    }
  }

  return {
    html: `The pokemon number ${params.number} is called ${state.name}`
  }
}
```

It is important to know that the state function is always resolved at the server side. That means that the `Pok√©API`
call will never be performed at the browser.

## Executing the state file

<PackageManager both="ragu-cli dev --file my-mfe.js --stateFile state.js --ssrEnabled" binExecution={true} />

Open the preview route providing the number parameter:
[http://localhost:3100/preview?number=1](http://localhost:3100/preview?number=1)

Let's take a look at the manifest file: [http://localhost:3100/?number=1](http://localhost:3100/?number=1).

```json {9,10,11}
{
  "dependencies": [],
  "client": "http://localhost:3100/compiled/client-side/my-mfe.[hash].js",
  "ssrEnabled": true,
  "static": false,
  "styles": [],
  "resolverFunction": "my-mfe_my-mfe",
  "html": "The pokemon number 1 is called bulbasaur",
  "state": {
    "name": "bulbasaur"
  },
  "props": {
    "number": "1"
  }
}
```
The state file is there and that's how Ragu transits information between the server and client-side.

:::info
The state mechanism is the same for any framework. There always will be a state file, also the state will be provided by
props at the micro-frontend function.
