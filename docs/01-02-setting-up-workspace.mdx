This guide explains how to set up your environment using the `ragu-cli` tool.
It includes installing the CLI, creating an initial workspace and simple micro-frontend,
and running that app locally to verify your setup.

## `optional` Start a Node project

If you don't have a project yet open your terminal and follow the steps bellow:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="yes"
  values={[
    {label: 'I already have a node project', value: 'yes'},
    {label: 'Tell me how to start one', value: 'no'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="yes">
    Nice ðŸ˜Ž! Follow the next steps then.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="no">
    Create a directory.
    <CodeBlock className="language-shell">mkdir my-mfe</CodeBlock>
    Open the directory you have created.
    <CodeBlock className="language-shell">cd my-mfe</CodeBlock>
    Create a node project
    <PackageManager npm="init" yarn="init" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Install the ragu-cli

You use the ragu-cli to build micro-frontends, develop and preview your micro-frontend.

To install the `ragu-cli`, open a terminal window and run the following command:

<InstallPackage isDev={true} packageName={'ragu-cli'} />

Ragu abstracts part of webpack configuration. It means that you should not worry about having a webpack config file if
you don't use any special loader. However, webpack must be installed manually to make sure Ragu is using the same
webpack version of your project. You can skip this step if you already have webpack installed.

<InstallPackage isDev={true} packageName={'webpack'} />

## Adapters

`ragu-cli` needs to know how to build your project. You must have an adapter installed.
For this example we will use the adapter for vanilla (a.k.a pure javascript) micro-frontends.

<InstallPackage isDev={true} packageName={'ragu-simple-adapter'} />

:::note
All the examples bellow is about exporting a javascript pure micro-frontend. There is even a smooth way to work with your favorite framework. Check React's and Vue's documentation for more info.
:::

## Creating a simple component

Open your favorite text editor and create a javascript file for out micro-frontend:

```javascript title="my-mfe.js"
export default () => {
  return {
    html: 'Hello, World'
  }
}
```

:::note
A Ragu micro-frontend is always a file that exports a `default` function.
:::

## Run the application

The Ragu includes a server, so that you can build and serve your app locally.

Run the following command to start the development server:

<PackageManager both="ragu-cli dev --file my-mfe.js" binExecution={true} />

The output should be like this:

```
ðŸ“¦ your build is ready!

Output path: .ragu-components
Base URL: http://localhost:3100

ðŸ—º Component Routes:
â–¸ mfe: http://localhost:3100/


ðŸ”­ Preview Routes:
â–¸ mfe: http://localhost:3100/preview


Welcome to ðŸ”ª Ragu
```

Now you can use your micro-frontend wherever you want even here!

<LoadMicroFrontend name="Your local micro-frontend" url="http://localhost:3100" hideDemo={true} />

## Check all available commands and options

If you are having troubles to remember any `ragu-cli` commands or options you can use the `--help` flag.

<PackageManager binExecution={true} both="ragu-cli --help" />

```
Usage: ragu-cli [options] [command]

Welcome to ragu-cli. Check the list of commands bellow:

Options:
  -V, --version     output the version number
  -h, --help        display help for command

Commands:
  dev [options]     Starts ragu server in development mode for the given component.
  static [options]  Build the project as a static ragu project
  build [options]   Build the project to production
  serve [options]   Production server. You must the same options given for build command.
  help [command]    display help for command
```

You can combine a `command` with the `--help` flag to list all available options for that command. Example:

<PackageManager binExecution={true} both="ragu-cli dev --help" />

```
Usage: ragu-cli dev [options]

Starts ragu server in development mode for the given component.
