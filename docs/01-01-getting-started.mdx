Ragu aims to deliver a simple and coupleless way to organize your front-end
into micro-frontends as an embeddable widget.

You can create a micro-frontend using any technology and embed it into any
application.

Ragu can also optionally deliver your front-end with `SSR` (Server Side Rendering)
and can deal with shared dependencies between micro-frontends making the user experience
even better.

## Micro-frontend as widgets

Ragu can inject a front-end made by any technology into any application.

It is specially useful for legacy system modernization since you don't
need to replace your entire application at once.

## Key features

- Injects a front-end into any application easily. You can easily inject a front-end even into that your 15-year-old
legacy code.
- Gives more autonomy for teams since they don't need to share an entire front-end monolith.
- Allows independently deployments since there is no need to update the main application when a micro-frontend has changed.
- Ragu comes with a built-in server which can render your front-end from the server.

## How it works?

Have you ever looked at the [Ragu's homepage code](https://ragu-framework.github.io/)? There are multiple front-ends injected
at that page. Ragu comes with a simple `cli` which builds your project and creates a `manifest`
file.

The `manifest` file contains all information needed to load that micro-frontend. You give the
`manifest` for Ragu and it will load your micro-frontend.

### Demo

Let's go thought Ragu's homepage micro-frontends and inject them independently.
