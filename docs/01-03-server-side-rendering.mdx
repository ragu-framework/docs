To enable `SSR` you should provide the `--ssrEnabled` flag. With this flag Ragu will start to return the micro-frontend
HTML rendered from server.

<PackageManager binExecution={true} both="ragu-cli dev --file my-mfe.js --ssrEnabled" />

```json {8}
{
  "dependencies": [],
  "client": "http://localhost:3100/compiled/client-side/my-mfe.[hash].js",
  "ssrEnabled": false,
  "static": false,
  "styles": [],
  "resolverFunction": "my-mfe_my-mfe",
  "html": "Hello, World",
  "state": null,
  "props": {}
}
```

After you activate the flag you will see a tiny difference into the micro-frontend's manifest file.
When `SSR` is enabled, Ragu's manifest returns the `html` property which is the result of your application.

## The state file (DRAFT)

Let's say you want your micro-frontend to perform an async operation, let's say fetch a request. You can use
a state file for this purpose. A state file is only executed from the server side, that means that the browser will
never perform that action. Also, the state will be passed as a property to your micro-frontend.
