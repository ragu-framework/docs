Ragu can inject a front-end made by any technology into any application. This article explains how to inject Ragu's
micro-frontends into a React application. You must have a React project set up.
If you don't have one, we recommend you to start one using
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installing the Client

The `ragu-client-react` provides a React component to inject Ragu micro-frontends into any React application.

<InstallPackage packageName="ragu-client-react" isDev={true} />

## Injecting a micro-frontend

To inject a micro-frontend you must provide a `manifest` url for one of the available Ragu clients.

1. Create a simple "Hello, World" micro-frontend that will be injected into our React application.

  ```jsx title="my-mfe.js"
  export default () => <div>
    Hello, World!
  </div>
  ```

2. Now start the micro-frontend.

  <PackageManager binExecution={true} both="ragu-cli dev --file my-mfe.js" />

  This command outputs the follow:

  ```
  ðŸ—º Component Routes:
  â–¸ my-mfe: http://localhost:3100/

  ðŸ”­ Preview Routes:
  â–¸ my-mfe: http://localhost:3100/preview
  ```

  The **Component Routes** section printed at the terminal describes the `manifest`'s routes and that is the `URL` we
  will use to fetch our micro-frontend.

3. Load the micro-frontend using the `manifest` URL using `RaguComponent`.

  ```jsx {6}
  import {RaguComponent} from "ragu-client-react";

  const App = () => {
    return <div>
      <h1>My micro-frontend:</h1>
      <RaguComponent src="http://localhost:3100" />
    </div>;
  }

  export default App;
  ```

4. Start the application and see it live!

  :::note Does not stop the micro-frontend server
  You should keep the micro-frontend running when you start the main application. Otherwise, it will not work.
  :::

  :::info Code Example
  The code of the examples above can be found [here](https://github.com/ragu-framework/docs/tree/main/examples/react/consuming).

### Providing props

If you want to provide props to a micro-frontend you can just pass it as `query parameter`. If you want to provide a
`name` parameter to the micro-frontend the `RaguComponent` should be called that way:

```jsx
import {RaguComponent} from "ragu-client-react";

<RaguComponent src="http://localhost:3100/?name=World" />
```

:::note
You can read more about providing props at the
[Core concepts / Consuming a micro-frontend](http://localhost:3000/docs/consuming-a-micro-frontend#injecting-a-micro-frontend)
section.

### Advanced options and callbacks:

```jsx
import {RaguComponent} from "ragu-client-react";

<RaguComponent
  src="http://localhost:300"
  onFetchFail={() => {
    alert('I was called because it was not possible to reach the manifest file URL.');
  }}
  onFetchCompleted={() => {
    alert('I was called because the manifest URL was called successfully.');
  }}
  onHydrateCompleted={() => {
    alert('I was called because the render process was completed and the micro-frontend is ready to interact with.');
  }}
  wrapper='div'
/>
```
