Ragu can inject a front-end made by any technology into any application.

It is specially useful for legacy system modernization since you don't
need to replace your entire application at once.

### Injecting a micro-frontend

To inject a micro-frontend you must provide a `manifest` url for one of the available Ragu clients.

Parameters should be passed as query parameters at the URL. Check it out some micro-frontends from Ragu's homepage been
