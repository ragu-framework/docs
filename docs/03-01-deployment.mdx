When you are ready to deploy your micro-frontend to a remote server, `ragu-cli` will make it easy.

## Building the project to production

The `ragu-cli build` command creates a production ready build. You should specify the `--outputPath` directory and the
`--baseUrl`.

<PackageManager
  binExecution={true}
  both="ragu-cli build --file my-mfe.js --baseurl https://my-mfe.my.org/ --outputPath build" />

:::info
If you don't specify the `ouputPath` it will assume the default directory `.ragu-components`.
:::

### The `baseURL` ðŸš¨

Ragu micro-frontends can be deployed anywhere, and it does not need to be deployed at the same domain of the main
application. The manifest should contain information about where to Ragu should retrieve the static files.
For this reason, the `--baseUrl` is required.

In the example above we are telling Ragu that the micro-frontend will be available at
**<span>https://my-mfe</span>.my.org/**.

:::info
After you run the `build` it will output at the terminal the list of all micro-frontends manifest location
where they will be available after the deployment. Take a look to ensure that the `--baseUrl` is configured properly.
:::

### Production server

To start the production server, you **must provide the same parameters** that were provided to the `ragu-cli build`
command. Optionally you can provide a `--port` to define the port where Ragu server should listen to.

<PackageManager
  binExecution={true}
  both="ragu-cli serve --file my-mfe.js --baseurl https://my-mfe.my.org/ --outputPath build --port 80"
/>

:::info
By default Ragu listen to the port `3100` when a `--port` is not specified.
:::

## Static Build (a.k.a. CDN deployment)

If your micro-frontend does not require any `SSR` feature ([Server Side Rendering section](/docs/server-side-rendering))
you can use the static build. The static build does not require the Ragu serve and can be deployed at any CDN.

To create a static build all you need is to change the previous build command from `build` to `static`.

<PackageManager
  binExecution={true}
  both="ragu-cli static --file my-mfe.js --baseurl https://my-mfe.my.org/ --outputPath build" />

Now you must deploy the content of the `build` directory into your static server/CDN in a way where the `build` path
content should be available through at the defined `--baseurl`.

#### Consuming a micro-frontend from static build

The manifest file generated as a `json` file. The example above will generate a file called `build/my-mfe.json` which
must be used as manifest file. For example:

<RaguComponentDemo url={"https://my-mfe.my.org/my-mfe.json"} />

:::warning
When using static build all `SSR` features will be disabled. That means that state files will be ignored.
:::

### Ragu server x Static Build

You should use Ragu server when you want to enable all the `SSR` power to your micro-frontends. Otherwise static build
is just fine.
