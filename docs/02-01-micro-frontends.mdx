Coined at ThoughtWorks Technology Radar 2016' release. Micro-frontends extends the micro-services ideas into the
front-end. Thought composition you can build a distributed front-end with independent deployment and with agnostic
technology.

Ragu provides a simple and sophisticated API to injects micro-frontend into any application. A Ragu micro-frontend is
like a back-end API endpoint where other applications can use. Actually, Ragu micro-frontend usages seems a lot similar
of using a back-end API.

## The micro-frontend API

Now that you have [setting up our front-end](/docs/setup) let's take a better look into the component API:

```javascript title="my-mfe.js"
export default () => {
  return {
    html: 'Hello, World'
  }
}
```

To inject the micro-frontend you need to provide the component `manifest` URL to one of the clients available.

You can load your micro-frontend using the vanilla client as showed bellow where `http://localhost:3100`
the `manifest` URL:

```html
<html>
<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ragu-dom@latest/install.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <ragu-component src="http://localhost:3100"></ragu-component>
</body>
</html>
```

The previous example outputs a `Hello, World` micro-frontend. Let's say, instead of
`Hello, World` we want to receive the name which the micro-frontend will say `Hello` to.

# Receiving parameters

The micro-frontend receives the name that must be shown by a parameter:

```javascript title="my-mfe.js"
export default ({params}) => {
  return {
    html: `Hello, ${params.name}`
  }
}
```

To inject the micro-frontend above you must provide the `params` as a `URL` query parameter:

```html
<ragu-component src="http://localhost:3100/?name=Universe"></ragu-component>
```

## Receiving parameters at the preview

To receive props at the preview all you must provide them thought query parameters:

[http://localhost:3100/preview?name=Universe](http://localhost:3100/preview?name=Universe)

## Other properties

There are few properties that is provided to a micro front-end. This section list them.

### props.isServer

When `true` means that this component is been rendered at the server side:

```javascript title="my-mfe.js"
export default ({params, isServer}) => {
  return {
    html: `Hello, ${params.name} from ${isServer ? 'server' : 'browser'}`
  }
}
```


### props.state

This property is used to transit information from server to client. Read more at the Server Side Rendering section.

### From client side

The properties listed bellow are available when `isServer=false`.

#### props.element

The container where the micro-frontend will be injected.

```javascript title="my-mfe.js"
export default ({isServer, element}) => {
  if (!isServer) {
    element.addEventListener('click', () => alert('Thanks!'));
  }

  return {
    html: `Click me`,
  }
}
```

### From server side

The properties listed bellow are available when `isServer=true`.

#### props.request

The express request object: [https://expressjs.com/pt-br/api.html#req](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/api.html#req)

#### props.config

The [RaguServerConfig](https://github.com/ragu-framework/ragu/blob/main/ragu-server/src/config.ts#L34).
